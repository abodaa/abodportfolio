          Hello ðŸ‘‹... My name is ABRAHAM, and I like making things that are
          accessible online. In 2018, I first became interested in web
          development when I chose to use Wordpress to create a straightforward
          website for a fictional business. For the past few years, I have
          worked as a freelance web developer, creating and designing websites
          for various clients. Back then, well-known open-source content
          management systems (CMS) such (WordPress, Drupal, Magento, and others)
          were my tools. Recently, I made the decision to pursue a career as a
          full stack web developer. I set out to learn about the latest full
          stack web development trends and technologies, so I began studying the
          courses that would be most useful to me. Since I am a quick learner, I
          think that taking part in any relevant projects will make me a
          valuable contributor to the success of the project. On the other hand,
          I will profit personally by learning from it.
