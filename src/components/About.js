          Hello ðŸ‘‹... I'm ABRAHAM, and I enjoy creating stuff that can be found
          online. I originally developed an interest in web development in 2018
          when I decided to use Wordpress to build a simple website for a
          made-up company. I've been a freelance web developer for the past few
          years, building and designing websites for various clients. I used
          popular open-source content management systems (CMS) at that time,
          including WordPress, Drupal, Magento, and others. I have learned and
          earned the exeperience working with the technologies in the
          MERN stack: MongoDB, ExpressJs, ReactJs and NodeJs in addition to the
          basic frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I
          believe that participating in any relevant projects will make me a
          meaningful contributor to the project's success because I am a quick
          learner. On the other side, by learning from it, I will benefit
          personally.ðŸ™‚
